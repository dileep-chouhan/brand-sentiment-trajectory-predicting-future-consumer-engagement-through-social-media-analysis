# Brand Sentiment Trajectory: Predicting Future Consumer Engagement Through Social Media Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes social media data to understand the trajectory of brand sentiment and predict future consumer engagement.  The analysis identifies key factors influencing sentiment fluctuations, allowing for proactive adjustments to marketing strategies.  The project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to gauge sentiment from social media posts and statistical modeling to forecast future engagement levels.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (or specify other ML libraries used)
* Tweepy (or specify other social media API library used)


## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`

**Note:** Ensure you have a suitable Python 3.x environment set up before running the project.  You may need to adjust paths or input data based on your specific setup.  If using a social media API, ensure you have the appropriate credentials configured.


## Example Output

The script will print a summary of the sentiment analysis to the console, including key statistics such as average sentiment scores over time, identified influential keywords, and the predicted future engagement levels.  Additionally, the project generates several visualization files (e.g., `sentiment_trend.png`, `engagement_prediction.png`) depicting the trends and predictions. These plots are saved in the `output` directory.  The exact output may vary depending on the input data and the model used.
